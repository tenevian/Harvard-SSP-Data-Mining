    "Anthropologist [Wayne Zachary (1977)](http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/an_information_flow_model_for_conflict_and_fission_in_small_groups.pdf) observed the social interactions between members of a small real-world [karate club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club) over a two year period. Toward the end of the study period a conflict arose which caused the club to split into 2. Some club members stayed connect to a group centered on a founder, Mr Hi. Other members started a new club. Zachary published his results in [1977](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3629752).   \n",

    "> **Required packages:** Before running the code in this notebook you will need to install the [NetworkX package](https://networkx.org/). The NetworkX has a dependency on [PyGraphViz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/). If you have not installed these packages un-comment the code below and install both. Especailly, if you are using the Windows OS, or have instalaiton problems on any OS, read these [PyGraphViz installation instructions](https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html) carefully. Finally, you will use the Louvain modularity algorithm from the Python [Community](https://python-louvain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package.   "
