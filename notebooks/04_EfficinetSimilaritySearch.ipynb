    "In these exercises you will gain some experience with methods for efficient similarity search. A naive similarity search requires a brute-force computation of all pairwise distances, in the chosen metrics. The brute-force approach is not scalable with computational complexity for $n$ observations of $O(n^2)$.    \n",
    "\n",
    "For massive datasets we need much more efficient methods. These methods fall into two broad categories. First **exact similarity search** or **exact nearest neighbor search** methods try to find the $k$ observations closest to a query vector, $q$. However, even the most efficient exact similarity search methods do not scale to high dimensional massive datasets. In order to perform similarity search on massive high-dimensional datasets we must use **approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS)** algorithms. As you will see, ANNS algorithms involve compromises between query speed, memory use and accuracy. Whereas, exact methods are expected to have a recall score of 1.0, we must expect lower recall from ANNS algorithms as the price paid for high query speed and low memory use.            \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will explore several widely used possibilities:        \n",
    "1. [**KD trees**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) are a widely used tree-based data structure used for low-dimensional data. KD-trees are constructed from recursive binary splits. For a dataset with $n$ observations and dimensionality, $d$, the computational complexity is $O\\big(d\\ n \\log(n) \\big)$. While not ideal linear scaling, $O(n)$, the KD tree is a significant improvement over brute-force methods. Generally, KD-trees are considered to be efficient for large datasets with $d \\le 20$. For higher dimensional data, R-trees and ball trees can be extended to higher dimensional data. We will apply ball trees for clustering and dimensionality reduction with the spectral clustering and UMAP algorithms.     \n",
    "2. [**Inverted Indexes**](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/vector-indexes/) are a course quantization method that divides a large search space. Inverted indexes can be search very quickly but do not achieve high recall rates. Typically, these algorithms are used in conjunction with finer search algorithms.    \n",
    "3. [**Product Quantization (PQ)**](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/product-quantization/) employs multi-level vector quantization. The PQ algorithm is provides fast queries with reasonable levels of recall. In addition, the PQ algorithm requires minimal memory, providing up to 97% compression!\n",
    "4. [**Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW)** graphs](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/hnsw/) are arguably the state of the art in ANNS. These algorithms use a hierarchy of graphs of increasing detail and accuracy. There is a trade-off between memory use query speed and recall (accuracy) for HNSW. Properly configured, HNSW can achieve high recall scores with reasonable scalability.\n",
    "5. [**Composite Indices**](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/composite-indexes/) use pipelines of to improve end to end performance, recall, query speed and memory use. These composites start with coarse quantization with inverted indices (IVF) and work toward fine ANN search in two or more steps. The number of possible pipeline combinations is quite large. In practice, there are a smaller number of widely used composites which are empirically known to work well for many problems.      \n",

    "## Composite Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, ANN search performance is improved by using a composite of indices. This approach builds on the strength of the various algorithms to improve recall, reduce memory use and improve query speed. The flow of the pipeline follows these general steps:   \n",
    "1. **Preprocessing and transformation** to (optionally) normalize and orthogonalize the vector values. Commonly used algorithms include scaling, PCA and OPQ rotations.    \n",
    "2. **Coarse quantization** for  to reduce computation and memory requirements. Algorithms commonly used include IVF, [inverted multi-index (IMI)](https://sites.skoltech.ru/app/data/uploads/sites/25/2014/12/TPAMI14.pdf), and HNSWN algorithms.   \n",
    "3. **Fine quantization** primarily for compression to reduce memory required and improve query speed. PQ or flat search are the most commonly used algorithms.    \n",
    "4. **Reorder results** by inverse distance so nearest neighbor is first on the list.      \n",
